**gram** is a tool to help you streamline your large language model
interactions.

### Development

Make sure you have [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.

```bash
bun install
bun run tauri dev
```

### Prior Art

**gram** is my personal, open-source version of tools similar to [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/) or
[Bolt](https://boltai.com/).
